# Database
SQL based database in C: <br />
This is something that I have wanted to do to see if I was capable on my own of building this in C. I have noticed that there even though C is a very base level coding language, it has a lot of functionallity, and I want to try playing with that a little. So here we go.
# Goals
This is what I want to accomplish and kinda how I want to see it layed out
- Storing information: <br />
  Within this I want to find a way to store the information within the data base and quickly get the info back out for editing. I believe formatting a text file in a JSON style input. This can be parsed down into information that will be used within the database.
- Displaying this information: <br />
  This is the important second part. We need to be able to display the information we are gathering and saving.
- Updating information: <br />
